Analyzing football player injury patterns using Python, Excel, and AI Studio.

This project analyzes multi-season football player injury data to uncover patterns related to age, position, match timing, and injury type. Data was collected manually and cleaned using Python and Excel, then modeled with AI Studio to identify high-risk factors.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python
- Excel
- AI Studio
  
## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Deep Learning

## Key Objectives
- Identify trends in injury type by player position and season
- Predict when injuries are likely to occur using ML models
  
## 🔍 Key Insights
- Defenders and midfielders have the highest injury rates
- Injury frequency peaks in the winter season
- Age group 28–32 shows increased injury risk
