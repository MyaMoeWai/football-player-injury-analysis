Analyzing football player injury patterns using Python, Excel, and AI Studio.

This project analyzes multi-season football player injury data to uncover patterns related to age, position, match timing, and injury type. Data was collected manually and cleaned using Python and Excel, then modeled with AI Studio to identify high-risk factors.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- Excel
- AI Studio

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Defenders and midfielders have the highest injury rates
- Injury frequency peaks in the winter season
- Age group 28–32 shows increased injury risk
